# Furry Pancake Forum

## Introduction

Furry pancake forum is a game information-sharing forum that provides sections of blogs for different types of games.

What we intend to do is to build a platform in which users could freely discuss anything related to games. They can either join the topics of the game that they prefer or post a new blog in the corresponding section if they want to share something.

## More About Sections

Sections would be listed on the main page in a structured way, each of which is about one game.

We are not going to divide games based on platforms. But we do intend to host sections on different platforms as they are a part of the game community.
